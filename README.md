# Detecting-Fraudulent-Credit-Card-Transaction
This project evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning models in detecting fraudulent transactions within a dataset of over 550,000 European cardholder transactions from 2023. Using scaled features and anonymized data for privacy, the study aims to develop and assess various machine learning algorithms to accurately differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The results will aid in creating more efficient fraud detection systems, thereby enhancing the security of financial transactions and reducing potential losses for cardholders and financial institutions.
